## Setup

### Windows (or your Unix-like system has pyenv setup)

If you want to create a virtual environment run these commands, if not, skip this step

`python -m venv env`

`env/Scripts/activate`

To install required dependencies run this command

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Unix-like system

Basically the same but change `python` to `python3` and run `source env/bin/activate` instead
