## Binary Releasing

I am currently using Linux, so I can't build binaries for Windows and Mac systems until I got automated build process figured out(which idk how long it's going to take)

If you want to build binaries for me on other systems, maybe you can create releases? I'm not sure how this works so contact me if you want to help

## Setup

> I would strongly recommend creating a virtual environment(especially on Linux systems), use `venv` or `virtualenv` at your choice.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies
